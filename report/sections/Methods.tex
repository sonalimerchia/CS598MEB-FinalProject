\section{Methods}
Finally I would like to implement both Lazac and another parsimony method that uses CNT. The paper lists improvements when solving both the small and large parsimony problems. Then I would like to compare the performance of ZCNT and CNT based models on simulated data so I have ground truth solutions to assess performance. 

The points of interest in this paper are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How well does ZCNT replicate CNT? How well does it replicate CN3?
    \item How does ZCNT behave when the corresponding CNT does not exist?
    \item How is 
\end{enumerate}
