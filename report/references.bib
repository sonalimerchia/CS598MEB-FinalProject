	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles require precise knowledge of their position and orientation in all weather and trafﬁc conditions for path planning, perception, control, and general safe operation. Here we derive these requirements for autonomous vehicles based on ﬁrst principles. We begin with the safety integrity level, deﬁning the allowable probability of failure per hour of operation based on desired improvements on road safety today. This draws comparisons with the localization integrity levels required in aviation and rail where similar numbers are derived at 10-8 probability of failure per hour of operation. We then deﬁne the geometry of the problem, where the aim is to maintain knowledge that the vehicle is within its lane and to determine what road level it is on. Longitudinal, lateral, and vertical localization error bounds (alert limits) and 95\% accuracy requirements are derived based on US road geometry standards (lane width, curvature, and vertical clearance) and allowable vehicle dimensions. For passenger vehicles operating on freeway roads, the result is a required lateral error bound of 0.57 m (0.20 m, 95\%), a longitudinal bound of 1.40 m (0.48 m, 95\%), a vertical bound of 1.30 m (0.43 m, 95\%), and an attitude bound in each direction of 1.50 deg (0.51 deg, 95\%). On local streets, the road geometry makes requirements more stringent where lateral and longitudinal error bounds of 0.29 m (0.10 m, 95\%) are needed with an orientation requirement of 0.50 deg (0.17 deg, 95\%).},

	abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) brought navigation to the masses. Coupled with smartphones, the blue dot in the palm of our hands has forever changed the way we interact with the world. Looking forward, cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars and aerial mobility are pushing the limits of what localization technologies including GNSS can provide. This autonomous revolution requires a solution that supports safety-critical operation, centimeter positioning, and cybersecurity for millions of users. To meet these demands, we propose a navigation service from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites which deliver precision in-part through faster motion, higher power signals for added robustness to interference, constellation autonomous integrity monitoring for integrity, and encryption / authentication for resistance to spoofing attacks. This paradigm is enabled by the ‘New Space’ movement, where highly capable satellites and components are now built on assembly lines and launch costs have decreased by more than tenfold. Such a ubiquitous positioning service enables a consistent and secure standard where trustworthy information can be validated and shared, extending the electronic horizon from sensor line of sight to an entire city. This enables the situational awareness needed for true safe operation to support autonomy at scale.},

This paper deals with the analytic derivation of the Doppler shift measured by a user on the surface of earth on a signal transmitted by a circular orbit LEO satellite. Two simpliﬁcations are performed to obtain the analytical expression of the Doppler shift as a function of time. First, during the visibility duration of the satellite at a terminal, the trajectory of the satellite with respect to the earth is approximated by a great circle arc. Second, the angular velocity of the satellite with respect to the user is assumed to be constant. Numerical results validate the approximations. Another result of our analysis is an expression for the visibility window duration of a satellite at a terminal as a function of the maximum elevation angle. An algorithm for estimating the parameters of the Doppler curve based on a couple of Doppler and Doppler-rate measurements is also presented.},

Through a novel path separation algorithm, mD-Track can resolve multipath at a much finer-grained resolution, isolating signals reflected off targets of interest. mD-Track can localize human passively at a high accuracy with just a single Wi-Fi transceiver pair. mD-Track also introduces novel methods to greatly streamline its estimation algorithms, achieving real-time operation.

The novelty of our work is our inclusion of observations of signals received at multiple sites, at multiple frequencies, and on multiple overpasses. We show that estimating the orbital elements and predicting the satellite path on its next overpass are dramatically improved by exploiting geometric and temporal diversity available in multiple ground sites and multiple overpasses.},

	abstract = {Traditional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) immunity to interference may be approaching a practical performance ceiling. Greater gains are possible outside traditional GNSS orbits and spectrum. GNSS from low Earth orbit (LEO) has long been viewed as promising but expensive, requiring large constellations for rapid navigation solutions. The recent emergence of commercial broadband LEO mega-constellations invites study on dual-purposing these for both communications—their primary mission—and a secondary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service. Operating at shorter wavelengths than traditional GNSS, these constellations would permit highly directive, relatively compact receiver antennas. PNT-speciﬁc onorbit resources would not be required: the transmitters, antennas, clocks, and spectrum of the hosting broadband network would sufﬁce for PNT. Non-cooperative use of LEO signals for PNT is an option, but cooperation with the constellation operator (“fusion” with its communications mission) eases the burden of tracking a dense, low-altitude constellation from the ground and enables a receiver to produce single-epoch stand-alone PNT solutions. This paper proposes such a cooperative concept, termed fused LEO GNSS. Viability hinges on opportunity cost, or the burden a secondary PNT mission imposes on the communications constellation operator. This is assessed in terms of time-spacebandwidth product and energy budget. It is shown that a near-instantaneous-ﬁx PNT service over ±60° latitude (covering 99.8\% of the world’s population) with positioning performance superior to traditional GNSS pseudoranging would cost less than 1.6\% of downlink capacity for the largest of the new constellations, SpaceX’s Starlink. This allocation is comparable to adding one user consuming 5.7 Mbps of broadband service to each cell.},

The framework is agnostic to the modulation and multiple access scheme adopted by LEO satellites. First, an analytical derivation of the received signal frequency spectrum is presented, which accounts for the highly dynamic channel between the LEO satellite and a terrestrial receiver. Second, a frequency domain-based blind Doppler discriminator is proposed. Third, a Kalman ﬁlter (KF)-based Doppler tracking algorithm is developed. Fourth, a blind beacon estimation framework for LEO satellites is proposed and its convergence properties are studied. Simulation results are presented showing successful beacon estimation and Doppler tracking of Starlink LEO satellites transmitting 5G orthogonal division multiple access (OFDM) signals. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the efﬁcacy of the proposed framework on multi-constellation LEO satellites, namely OneWeb, Starlink, Orbcomm, and Iridium NEXT. Despite adopting different modulation and multiple access transmission schemes, the proposed framework is capable of successfully estimating the beacon and tracking the Doppler, in a blind fashion, of 8 LEO satellites (2 OneWeb, 4 Starlink, 1 Iridium NEXT, and 1 Orbcomm) over a period of about 560 seconds with Hz-level accuracy. The produced Doppler measurements were fused through a nonlinear least-squares estimator to localize a stationary receiver to an unprecedented level of accuracy. Starting with an initial estimate about 3,600 km away, a ﬁnal three-dimensional (3–D) position error of 5.8 m and 2–D position error of 5.1 m was achieved. Aside from achieving this unprecedented accuracy, these results represent the ﬁrst successful opportunistic tracking of unknown OneWeb LEO signals and their exploitation for positioning.},

abstract = {Imagine being able to listen to the birds chirping in a park without hearing the chatter from other hikers, or being able to block out traffic noise on a busy street while still being able to hear emergency sirens and car honks. We introduce semantic hearing, a novel capability for hearable devices that enables them to, in real-time, focus on, or ignore, specific sounds from real-world environments, while also preserving the spatial cues. To achieve this, we make two technical contributions: 1) we present the first neural network that can achieve binaural target sound extraction in the presence of interfering sounds and background noise, and 2) we design a training methodology that allows our system to generalize to real-world use. Results show that our system can operate with 20 sound classes and that our transformer-based network has a runtime of 6.56 ms on a connected smartphone. In-the-wild evaluation with participants in previously unseen indoor and outdoor scenarios shows that our proof-of-concept system can extract the target sounds and generalize to preserve the spatial cues in its binaural output.
